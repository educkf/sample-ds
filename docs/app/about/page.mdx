# About Us

Welcome to our **amazing** application! This page is written in MDX, which allows us to combine Markdown with React components.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX embedded inside markdown. It's a great way to write content-rich pages that can include:

- Interactive components
- Dynamic content
- Beautiful typography
- Code examples

## Our Mission

> To build incredible web experiences using modern technologies like Next.js and MDX.

Here's what we do:

1. **Create** amazing user interfaces
2. **Develop** robust applications
3. **Deploy** with confidence

## Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript example:

```javascript
function welcome(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to our MDX page.`;
}

console.log(welcome('Developer'));
```
