# Markdoc Test Page

This is a test page to verify if Markdoc custom tags are working.

## Test Component

{% test message="If you can see this styled blue box, Markdoc tags are working!" /%}

## Regular Content

This is regular markdown content.

If the test component above shows as a styled blue box with an emoji, then Markdoc custom tags are working correctly.

If you only see raw text like `{% test message="..." /%}`, then Markdoc is not processing the tags.
